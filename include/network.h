 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Class Network represents the porous material as a network of pores, nodes and grains.
 * Flow of reagents through the network results in dissolution and optionally precipitation reactions.
 * As a results of those reactions the pores properties will change.
 *
 * Class Network consist of list of all pores, nodes and grains and all physical parameters governing the reaction.
 * Additionally in the class Network there are control parameters for the entire simulation.
